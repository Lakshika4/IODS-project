# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you should use R Markdown syntax.*

2. I have worked with Rstudio briefly almost two years ago. Going trough from chapter 1 to 5 helped a lot to refresh my memories. I mainly work with Python. Hence, concept and the basics of coding not new to me. I think it will help a lot to work with R as the logic is quite similar. I need to get familiarize my self with the libraries and functions used in R-studio.I don't have a favorite chapter at the moment, but I liked the chapter "Different types of plots" because I always likes to visualize data. At the moment I feel like I can make it. I'm expecting to learn on the statistical method used when processing data. I searched for open data science courses in Sisu and came across with this course.
